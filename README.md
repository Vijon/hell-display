# Hell Display #

This experiment comes from a vision: a screen that is powered by a community by displaying and automatically reproducing the various types of content: audio, video, photos, text ...

Of course there is no moderation or censorship, so the danger of incurring inappropriate material is very high. 
Hence the name "Hell Display". A hellish monitor that not everyone will have the courage to keep open.

The contents are "launched" via Telegram. In fact, a bot has been built to receive content and turn it through websocket to the application.

Once the development of the SPA was finished I thought of packaging everything in a PWA desktop to allow installing the application. I have also implemented web push notification management.
